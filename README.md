### second slide
 - The content type will now appear in the template so the user can add content.

### PLANNING 
 - THIS WAY IS NOT WORKING SO NOW I AM GOING TO APPEND ALL BLOCK ELEMENT INTO DROP ZONE (ELEMENT ID)
 - BY USING CSS I WILL STYLE TOP OF THE COLUMN DIV BY USING POSITION ABSOLUTE 
 - OR WE CAN REMOVE BELOW DIV AND USE CREATE NEW DIV THAT WE WANT TO APPEND OUR BLOCK

 - OR WE CAN MADE THE EVENT LISTENER OR ACTION ABOVE WHERE WE MADE THE ELEMENT dropableColumnZone

 - OR WE CAN MADE COLUMN ELEMENT GLOBALLY(OUTSIDE OF ANY FUNCTION OR LOOP) SO WE CAN ACCESS ANYWARE 
 - OR WE CAN SEECT DIRECTLY FROM THE ELEMENT // document.addEventListener   == IT'S WORKED üòä



 - BY POSITION FIND OUT THE COLUMN INDEX NUMBER 
 - FIND OUT IN WHICH COLUMN AND WHICH ROW OUR ELEMENT IS LOCATED   == IT'S WORKED üòä
 - SET ONE MORE ATTRIBUTE IN COLUMN BLOCK THAT CAN DIFFERENTTHIATE EACH ELEMENT   == IT'S WORKED üòä




 - AT FIRST GET ROW ID AND COL ID*
 
 
 - MAKE AN ON CHANGE EVENT ATTRIBUTE IN THE BLOCK ELEMENT WE HAVE CREATED TO CHANGE ANYTHING   == IT'S WORKED üòä
 - EVERYTIME WHEN CHANGE THE ROW LIST AND ROW POSITION ELELMENT WE CAN CREATE ELEMENT AND UPDATE ELEMENT

 - MAKE ALL THE ELEMENT VARTICALLY AND HORIZONTALLY RESPONSIVE






 - INSIDE PROPERTY CHANGE OR CLICK EVENT ->GET ROW AND COL NUMBER -> ACCORDING TO ROW AND COL NUMBER UPDATE ELEMENT POSITION ARRAY WITH RESENTLY INPUTED VALUE   == IT'S WORKEDüòä
 - SAVE HTML ELEMENT WITH RIGHT COLUMN AND RIGHT ROW    == IT'S WORKEDüòä
 - FROM CLICK OR CHANGE EVENT OF PROPERTY CHANGE THE ELEMENT ATTRIBUTE OF TEMPLATE 
 - DROP THE BUTTON INSIDE ANOTHER ELEMENT 






 - PROBLEM WITH CHANGING TEXT CONTENT OF TEXT BLOCK   == IT'S WORKEDüòä
 - SOME PROBLEM WITH HYPERLINK AND NEW TEXT OF TEXT EDITOR  == IT'S WORKEDüòä
 - WORK TO SHOW ALL THE CHANGED ELEMENT INSIDE TEMPLATE  == IT'S WORKEDüòä
 - WORK WITH BUTTON PROPERTIES  == IT'S WORKEDüòä
 - WORK WITH SPACING


 - WORK WITH IMAGE
