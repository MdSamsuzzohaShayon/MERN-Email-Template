# Simple Storage Solution

### Node.js S3
 - Navigate to S3 -> create bucket -> set a unique bucket name (email-template-aws-bucket) -> Make everything else as default and done
 - Now go to the bucket -> 
 - **Bucket access permission** -> Aws services -> **IAM** -> Polacies -> Create policy -> Visual Editor -> Services: Choose S3, Actions: under write --> Delete Object, Actions: under read --> Get Object, Resources: Add ARN --> Bucket name: email-template-aws-bucket, Object name: check any -> Done
 - Add tag(no need) -> review -> Keep a name: email-template-aws-policy -> create policy 
 - Aws -> IAM -> Access Management -> Users -> Add User -> username: emailTemplateUser, Access type: programatic access 
 - Set permissions -> attach existing policies -> search for policy we made -> email-template-aws-policy : checked -> Add tags -> review -> create user
 - Once we create user and policy we can get **access key id** and **secret access key**
