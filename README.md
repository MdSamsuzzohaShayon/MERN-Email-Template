### PLANNING

 - BY USING CSS I WILL STYLE TOP OF THE COLUMN DIV BY USING POSITION ABSOLUTE 
 - OR WE CAN REMOVE BELOW DIV AND USE CREATE NEW DIV THAT WE WANT TO APPEND OUR BLOCK

 - OR WE CAN MADE THE EVENT LISTENER OR ACTION ABOVE WHERE WE MADE THE ELEMENT dropableColumnZone

 - OR WE CAN MADE COLUMN ELEMENT GLOBALLY(OUTSIDE OF ANY FUNCTION OR LOOP) SO WE CAN ACCESS ANYWARE 
 - OR WE CAN SEECT DIRECTLY FROM THE ELEMENT // document.addEventListener   == IT'S WORKED üòä



 - BY POSITION FIND OUT THE COLUMN INDEX NUMBER 
 - FIND OUT IN WHICH COLUMN AND WHICH ROW OUR ELEMENT IS LOCATED üòä
 - SET ONE MORE ATTRIBUTE IN COLUMN BLOCK THAT CAN DIFFERENTTHIATE EACH ELEMENT üòä




 - AT FIRST GET ROW ID AND COL ID*
